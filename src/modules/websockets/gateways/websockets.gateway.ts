/**
 * WebSocket Gateway
 *
 * Handles low-level WebSocket operations and socket.io events.
 *
 * Core functionality to implement:
 *
 * 1. Connection Events:
 *    - handleConnection(socket): Handle new client connections
 *    - handleDisconnect(socket): Handle client disconnections
 *    - handleError(socket, error): Handle connection errors
 *    - handleReconnect(socket): Handle client reconnections
 *
 * 2. Message Events:
 *    - handleMessage(socket, data): Process incoming messages
 *    - handleJoinRoom(socket, roomName): Handle room joining
 *    - handleLeaveRoom(socket, roomName): Handle room leaving
 *    - handlePrivateMessage(socket, data): Handle private messages
 *
 * 3. Broadcasting:
 *    - broadcastMessage(event, data): Broadcast to all clients
 *    - sendToRoom(roomName, event, data): Send to room members
 *    - sendToClient(clientId, event, data): Send to specific client
 *    - sendToClients(clientIds, event, data): Send to multiple clients
 *
 * 4. Room Management:
 *    - joinRoom(socket, roomName): Add socket to room
 *    - leaveRoom(socket, roomName): Remove socket from room
 *    - getRoomMembers(roomName): Get room member count
 *    - createRoom(roomName): Create new room
 *    - deleteRoom(roomName): Delete room
 *
 * 5. Socket Utilities:
 *    - getSocketById(socketId): Get socket by ID
 *    - getConnectedSockets(): Get all connected sockets
 *    - disconnectSocket(socketId): Force disconnect socket
 *    - emitToSocket(socket, event, data): Emit to specific socket
 *
 * Dependencies to consider:
 * - @nestjs/websockets for WebSocket decorators
 * - socket.io for WebSocket implementation
 * - Authentication guards for connection validation
 * - Rate limiting for message throttling
 * - Logger for connection events
